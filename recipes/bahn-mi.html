    <h2>Description</h2>
    This Vietnamese banh mi sandwich is tasty and a nice break from common sandwiches. The garlic chili 
    sauce is common in Asian sections of markets but Indonesian sambal or Korean chili paste can also be substituted. 
    Beer or red wine is the beverage of choice for this authentic recipe of French-influenced Vietnamese cuisine.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless pork loin chops, cut 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>4 (7 inch) French bread baguettes, split lengthwise</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 ounce chile sauce with garlic</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>1 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    Preheat the oven's broiler. Place the pork chops on a broiling pan and set under the broiler. 
    Cook for about 5 minutes, turning once, or until browned on each side.
    
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    Open the French rolls and spread mayonnaise on the insides. Place one of the cooked pork chops into each roll. 
    Spread chile sauce directly on the meat. Sprinkle with a little lime juice and top with slices of onion, cucumber, 
    cilantro, salt and pepper. Finish with another quick drizzle of lime juice.
