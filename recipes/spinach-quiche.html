    <h2>Description</h2>
    This crustless quiche made with eggs, spinach, and Muenster cheese is perfect to serve at any meal. 
    With no heavy crust to make, this light-tasting quiche is ready in under an hour. 

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained, and squeezed dry</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Muenster cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch pie pan. 

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 
    about 3 minutes. Stir in spinach and continue to cook until excess moisture has evaporated. 

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    Whisk together eggs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add Muenster cheese and spinach mixture and stir until 
    well blended. Pour into the prepared pan. 

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    Bake in the preheated oven until eggs have set, about 30 minutes. 

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
